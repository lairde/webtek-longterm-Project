						   <li>A global system of interconnected computer networks that <br>
						   use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide.</li><br>
						   <li>is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business,<br> and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of <br> electronic,

						   <li>In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from 
						   the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) and the European Commission. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and 
						   recommendations to improve the quality of the Web</li>

						     <li>HTTP resources are identified using URIs (specifically, HTTP URLs)</li>
